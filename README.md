## Personal Search engine (bookmarks + external search)

### What is this ?

Have you been frustrated that you have this bootload of quality of bookmarks, but whenever you need something it is much faster to
just fire a browser and do a Google search.
You no longer need to do that. Enter the Personal search engine (PSE), which you can use to index your bookmarks and search like 
you do with Google.
But wait there is more, when you issue your search query the PSE in the background does a Google search (or other search if you implemnt it :))
and displays both results.
